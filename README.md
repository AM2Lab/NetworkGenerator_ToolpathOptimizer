We hope our Grasshopper codes are valuable to the generation of your channel networks and/or toolpaths for 3D-printing.
<br>The following videos explain the structure of the scripts and how to use them:
<ul>
  <li>SingleChannel_ToolpathAngle_v1: [url coming soon]</li>
  <li>NetworkGenerator_ToolpathAngle_v1: [url coming soon]</li>
</ul>
If you use any part of our custom Grasshopper code in your own projects, we kindly ask you to reference our paper and the file name:
